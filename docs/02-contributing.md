# Contribution Guidelines

First of all, thanks for thinking of contributing to this project. :smile: Please follow the following instructions while contributing to any of our projects.

Before creating a Pull Request, please make sure that you're assigned the task on a GitHub issue. 

- If a relevant issue already exists, discuss on the issue and get it assigned to yourself on GitHub.
- If no relevant issue exists, open a new issue and get it assigned to yourself on GitHub.

Please proceed with a Pull Request only after you're assigned. It'd be sad if your Pull Request (and your hard work) isn't accepted because of incompatibility or someone else already finishing it.

When you start working on the issue, please kindly update the status in the project to `In Progress`

When you create a PR, make sure that you include a bit of description to what the PR introduces to the code base. And if possible, make your PRs as small possible so that we can review and merge it quickly.

When your PR is ready, make sure to request for review from the person who assigned you to the issue.
