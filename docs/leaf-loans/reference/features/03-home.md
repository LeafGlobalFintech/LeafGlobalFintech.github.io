# Home

The home component does not have it's own data and domain layer. It instead uses the repository layer from other features.

All these repositories are being used in the provider for the home component. 

The presentation layer has analytics to track essential events. The two events that are being tracked here are user interaction with the active loan card and user interaction with the show more button ont the transaction history preview.
