# Remote Config

In order to enable and disable some features remotely, we are using Firebase Remote Config. The interface being overridden here is `RemoteConfiguration` and it defines 5 methods to get the actually values for the settings set on the Firebase console.

More about Firebase Remote Config can be found [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/remote-config).
