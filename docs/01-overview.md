# Overview

This section of the documentation goes in a bit of detail about how the Loans App is constructed, what is needed to run it and also about the features it currently has. 

To avoid redundancy, things that are well explained by the code aren't mentioned often in the docs. 

As our codebase is still evolving, we are going to be updating the documentation to reflect the current state of the codebase.

Thanks for checking it out!
