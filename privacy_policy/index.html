How much information we collect depends on the type of settings of the device you use to access the App. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Locations settings on your device.

We use the data as part of our decision process to assess your creditworthiness for a loan with us. We may also use your data to assess your interest in receiving financial services through algorithms and mathematical modelling.</p><p>To protect your identity, we remove all personal identifiers (if any) and pseudonymize such information. Any metadata processed in this way cannot be used to reproduce the original data collected. Here are the examples how our official third party vendor, Credolab, collects the metadata: </p><ul><li>Credolab‚Äôs mobile technology may count the number of calendar events scheduled and their time stamp. Only this information is sent to Credolab‚Äôs servers, NOT the underlying raw data. </li><li>While Credolab‚Äôs mobile technology may scan and process your phone book contacts on your mobile device and may have the ability to send names and contact details to Credolab‚Äôs servers, the names and contact details are NOT sent to Credolab‚Äôs servers. </li><li>While Credolab‚Äôs mobile technology may scan and process information about the list of applications installed on your mobile device, Credolab will only collect data relating to the frequency of use of such applications but NOT the activities you engage on any such application. </li><li>Credolab‚Äôs mobile technology may count the number of registered accounts, including your social accounts. However, Credolab will only NOT access the social media profiles and Credolab will NOT analyze the information in the apps connected with them. </li><li>Credolab‚Äôs mobile technology may count the total time you spent to apply for a loan, the time you spent in the same position, how fast you scrolled application etc. While our Credolab‚Äôs technology may scan and process such information, Credolab do NOT read the content of what you type in the application form.</li><li>CredoLab calculates the alternative credit score by analyzing only METADATA, not personal data.

At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="9-do-we-make-updates-to-this-notice">9.
