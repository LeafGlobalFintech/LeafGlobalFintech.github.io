Depending on how you interact with us, this log data may include your IP address, device information, browser type and settings and information about your activity in the App (such as the date/time stamps associated with your usage, pages and files viewed, searches and other actions you take such as which features you use), device event information (such as system activity, error reports (sometimes called &#x27;crash dumps&#x27;) and hardware settings).</li><li><em>Device Data.</em> We collect device data such as information about your computer, phone, tablet or other device you use to access the App. Depending on the device used, this device data may include information such as your IP address (or proxy server), device application identification numbers, location, browser type, hardware model Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, operating system configuration information.</li><li><em>Location Data.</em> We may collect information data such as information about your device&#x27;s location, which can be either precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type of settings of the device you use to access the App. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Locations settings on your device. Note however, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the Services.</li></ul><p>Information collected through our App</p><p><em>In Short:  We collect information regarding your geo-location, mobile device, push notifications, when you use our App.</em></p><p>If you use our App, we also collect the following information:</p><ul><li><em>Geo-Location Information.</em> We may request access or permission to track location-based information from your mobile device, either continuously or while you are using our App, to provide certain location-based services. If you wish to change our access or permissions, you may do so in your device&#x27;s settings.</li><li><em>Mobile Device Access.</em> We may request access or permission to certain features from your mobile device, including your mobile device&#x27;s camera, contacts, reminders, SMS messages, social media accounts, storage, and other features. If you wish to change our access or permissions, you may do so in your device&#x27;s settings.</li><li><em>Mobile Device Data.</em> We automatically collect device information (such as your mobile device ID, model and manufacturer), operating system, version information and system configuration information, device and application identification numbers, browser type and version, hardware model Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, and Internet Protocol (IP) address (or proxy server). If you are using our App, we may also collect information about the phone network associated with your mobile device, your mobile device&#x27;s operating system or platform, the type of mobile device you use, your mobile device&#x27;s unique device ID and information about the features of our App you accessed but only as strictly necessary for the functioning of the App.</li><li><em>Push Notifications.</em> We may request to send you push notifications regarding your account or certain features of the App. If you wish to opt-out from receiving these types of communications, you may turn them off in your device&#x27;s settings.</li></ul><p>The information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our App, for troubleshooting and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.</p><p>Third party data collected through the App</p><p>We collect data of your phone to provide a segmented risk profile and generate an aggregated statistical information. We use the data as part of our decision process to assess your creditworthiness for a loan with us. We may also use your data to assess your interest in receiving financial services through algorithms and mathematical modelling.</p><p>To protect your identity, we remove all personal identifiers (if any) and pseudonymize such information. Any metadata processed in this way cannot be used to reproduce the original data collected. Here are the examples how our official third party vendor, Credolab, collects the metadata: </p><ul><li>Credolab’s mobile technology may count the number of calendar events scheduled and their time stamp. Only this information is sent to Credolab’s servers, NOT the underlying raw data. </li><li>While Credolab’s mobile technology may scan and process your phone book contacts on your mobile device and may have the ability to send names and contact details to Credolab’s servers, the names and contact details are NOT sent to Credolab’s servers. </li><li>While Credolab’s mobile technology may scan and process information about the list of applications installed on your mobile device, Credolab will only collect data relating to the frequency of use of such applications but NOT the activities you engage on any such application. </li><li>Credolab’s mobile technology may count the number of registered accounts, including your social accounts. However, Credolab will only NOT access the social media profiles and Credolab will NOT analyze the information in the apps connected with them. </li><li>Credolab’s mobile technology may count the total time you spent to apply for a loan, the time you spent in the same position, how fast you scrolled application etc. While our Credolab’s technology may scan and process such information, Credolab do NOT read the content of what you type in the application form.</li><li>CredoLab calculates the alternative credit score by analyzing only METADATA, not personal data. CredoLab does not share raw data with us</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="2-how-do-we-use-your-information">2.
